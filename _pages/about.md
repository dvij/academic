<p>I am a research scientist at <a href="http://deepmind.com">DeepMind</a> working on building robust and verifiable AI systems. A good summary of my recent research can be found in <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/verified_robustness_greece.pdf"> this talk</a>. </p>

<p> More generally, I am interested in building principled algorithmic techniques to reason about the behavior of complex autonomous systems. In the past, I have worked on ensuring that electric power grids remain well-behaved despide the presnece of large amounts of fluctuating renewable generation sources like solar and wind energy. </p>

<p> Before DeepMind, I spent time as a researcher at <a href="http://www.pnnl.gov">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a> and at <a href="http://www.cms.caltech/edu">Caltech</a>. Eons ago, I was as a carefree student at <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu">UW</a> and  <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>. </p>
